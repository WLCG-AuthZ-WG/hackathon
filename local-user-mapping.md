# Local user mapping

We have established mapping mechanisms (i.e., LCMAPS, Argus) to map X509
certificates and VOMS attribute information to local UNIX accounts.

Do we need a similar mapping mechanism also for tokens?
What are the requirements that have emerged up to now?
Can we have a common approach?
